                    <div>There is such a big tree in the forest,<br>Like other big trees, they are ordinary,<br>The only difference is that he is the only one in the whole forest who can't speak.<br><br>Because he can't speak, and there are no lively animals to make his home in him,<br>So he seems to have been alone since childhood.<br>The growth of a person is also very good, he comforts himself like this.<br><br>Although he can't speak, he always writes his own poems in his heart,<br>Every day he lived was written in the annual rings circle by circle.<br>Hidden inside, there are bridges of seven colors that I saw when I was a child,<br>There is a white cotton jacket that he puts on every once in a while,<br>And there, a dandelion, the one at his feet.<br><br>The big tree can't talk, so the other big trees don't have much to talk about with him.<br>There was only that little dandelion, always chattering beside him,<br>Talk about the little butterfly she knows and the little stream she passed by.<br><br>Big tree couldn't make a sound to reply, but he always listened carefully,<br>At the same time also pays attention to the sun, and puts the dandelion in his shadow at any time,<br>Dandelion won't sweat profusely from the sun when telling a story,<br>That's all he can do.<br><br>However, dandelions are not the same as big trees after all.<br>Autumn came, and the dandelion's clothes turned lifeless yellow,<br>The big tree knows that when his leaves turn yellow, they will fall off and disappear into the soil.<br>He was worried, he didn't know if the dandelion would also wither like his leaves and disappear in the soil.<br><br>But Dandelion is not worried at all,<br>She is a traveller, and she flies out the seeds in summer,<br>Overcoming the cold winter, the next year will appear where she buried the seeds,<br>start the next life.<br><br>She told the big tree, I'm leaving in winter, don't miss me,<br>The big tree shook his head, and the dead leaves clapped like a cry.<br>The big tree can't bear her, although the dandelion will not disappear,<br>But next year she won't be here.<br><br>Where did she bury the seeds?<br>Will there be birds that eat randomly in the next place?<br>Will there be a big tree to shelter her from the wind and rain?<br><br>The big tree is very sad, but he is a tree, he can't walk, can't speak,<br>He can't tell Dandelion to take care of himself,<br>Can't ask her if she will come back in the future?<br>The tree could only shake its head, and his leaves fell one by one.<br><br>Dandelion is still talking enthusiastically,<br>She said she was going to travel around the world, the duty of the traveller,<br>It is to extend the footprints into the distance.<br><br>She suddenly asked the big tree, do you know where I buried the seeds?<br>The big tree just kept shaking his head.<br>Dandelion smiled and said mysteriously, "Hey, hey, it's a beautiful place.<br><br>Winter came as promised, and the dandelions disappeared.<br>The tree put all his fallen leaves in the place where the dandelion used to be.<br>She once said that she was most afraid of the cold of winter,<br>The big tree just thought, then I will give you all the leaves as a quilt,<br>Goodbye, Miss Dandelion, thank you, stay with me for a spring and autumn,<br>After that, I was alone again.<br><br>The following year, spring came, and the breeze brought a touch of warmth from the south.<br>"Hey, did you miss me?"<br>A voice sounded, and beside him, there was a dandelion!<br>Right next to the original Miss Dandelion location,<br>They are very similar, are they her sisters?<br><br>"Hey, look here, it's me, don't you recognize me?<br>Hee hee hee, I didn't expect it, I buried the seeds here.<br>In fact, you are my world,<br>I won't leave without wrapping you around. "<br><br>It turned out to be Miss Dandelion!<br>The big tree wrote one more stroke in the annual ring,<br>"The Miss Dandelion I like is back!"</div>
